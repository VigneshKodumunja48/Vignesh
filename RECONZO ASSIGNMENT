## **Data Cleaning Process**

1. **Handling Missing Values**:

   - Replaced missing values with placeholders or default values using Power BIâ€™s "Replace Values" feature.
   - Columns like "Warehouse," "Return Courier," and "Received Date" had significant missing data, which were appropriately managed.

2. **Correcting Data Types**:

   - Ensured columns such as "AWB Number" and "Order ID" were set to text.
   - Columns like "Return Quantity" and "SKU" were formatted as numbers.
   - Dates were converted to proper date formats for analysis.

3. **Removing Unnecessary Columns**:

   - Dropped irrelevant columns (e.g., unnamed indices) to streamline the analysis.
